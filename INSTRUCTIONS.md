INSTRUCTIONS

Using a laser cutter or laser cutting service, cut the pieces included in the dxf file from a 3 mm acrylic sheet.

To assemble you will need

4 6/32 machine screw
4 6/32 nuts

4 screws included in your Maslow Kit to fix the Arduino, 
4 plastic risers included in your Maslow Kit to lift the Arduino off the frame. (I have included some in the dxf in case you don't have them)

Wires available here https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EFIX0OU/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_fgpfDbJJQATTQ

You will want to cut the wires to length, the terminals could be soldered, or in my case, I pushed the pins on the connector inside each wire and then secured them with a blob of hot glue across all pins.

I glued the receiving terminals to the case using super glue.

Good luck and leave some comments if you found this project useful.
